# Image

Currently, Bianbu provides two formats of images:

- **SD Card Raw Images**

  Files ending with `*.img.zip`. These can be written to an SD card using [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), or by extracting the file and using the `dd` command.

- **Custom Images**

  Files ending with `.zip`. These can be flashed using **Titan Flasher**, or manually using `fastboot` after extracting the contents.

Default root password: `bianbu`
