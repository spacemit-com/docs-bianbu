4. Run `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8` to temporarily switch the terminal language to English and avoid character encoding issues:

5. Run the command `passwd username` to change the user's password, for example, to reset the password for user `bianbu`, as shown below

### Issues You May Encounter During Bianbu 2.0.x Upgrade

#### Prompt: `Please install all available updates for your release before upgrading`

1. Run the command `sudo apt upgrade` to reinstall the versions from the source.

2. Re-run the upgrade command `do-release-upgrade -f DistUpgradeViewGtk3`.
